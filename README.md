## Hey, 🙋🏼‍♂️
<p>I'm Bikrom Aditya Roy 😎</p>

<b> https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5616AQG19v3Ia1hT0g/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1702080524637?e=1707955200&v=beta&t=uUb1ac19gkBr3s7reFNrJXxNdJrrstgV0w1bfuyosi0 </b>

<p>Studying CSE at Daffodil International University, Dhaka. I enjoy the field of different languages and frameworks like Python.
I am dedicated to continuously learning and growing in my area, seeking new challenges and professional upliftment opportunities.
I listen to inquisitive attention animus and am consistent with my goal. 
As a Class Representative, I should acquire soft skills (problem-solving, time management, teamwork, leadership, empathy, and creative thinking),  and solid skills (Presentation, Coding, and Certificated). 
I love solving code in Python and developing many real-life projects. I am interested in ML(NLP), IoT, and Embedded systems—an active member in NLP& ML Lab, CPC.
I will ever have new experiences, pay a visit to new people, and reach new wisdom.  I discover new thoughts and creative ideas to help others. An inventive mind helped me ascend and construct my to-be vocation.
